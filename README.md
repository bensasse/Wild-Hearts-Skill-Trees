# Wild-Hearts-Skill-Trees
Early Rough draft of wild hearts Staff skill tree. If theres enough good foodback I will start working on other weapons.
In order to use the tree properly you need to download the file and open it in excel.
For you some of you the macros might be blocked for security purposes. You need to right click the file and at the bottom check the box that says "unblock" then hit apply. Should be gtg from there.

Once you have it open in excel - you can progress down the trees selecting the buffs that you want to take along the way. Once you have what you want - hit the "buff list" button at the top left and it will aggregate all of the buffs you have selected along your path. Please note - its a very early implementation and will still need a lot of work.
