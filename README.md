# Wild-Hearts-Skill-Trees
Early Rough draft of wild hearts Staff skill tree. If theres enough good foodback I will start working on other weapons.
In order to use the tree properly you need to download the file and open it in excel.
For you some of you the macros might be blocked for security purposes. You need to right click the file and at the button check the box that says "unblock" then hit apply. Should be gtg from there.
